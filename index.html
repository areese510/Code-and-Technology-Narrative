  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am Amanda Reese. I am a teacher at Duquesne City School District. I teach 6th grade ELA and SS. I have been teaching at Duquesne for 10 years. When I was younger, I would use AOL and AIM for instant messaging to talk to friends. I use to play many computer games as a young kid. Before coming to this training I did not know much about code. When I taught 3rd grade I used Code.org before, but it was used more for independent work. I obviously used technology every day, but not to the extent we talked about the past two days. I have learned so much and how I can take it back into my ELA classroom. My mind is already working on how I can incorporate things into my ELA lessons. I have enjoyed learning more about coding especially Phoenix Code and GitHub. I think technology is always changing and advancing. Technology allows teachers to create and share content with many people.  </p>

Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->



<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>I learned that I spend a lot of time on Social Apps. I also get a lot of notifications in a day. I spend a lot of time in general on my phone. Since I am not currently working, I feel like I tend to be on my phone a lot more versus when I am working. I also compared different weeks to see if my data usage increased or decreased. When looking I found that last week’s average was about 8 hrs which was up 7% from the following week. Looking at my notifications, I noticed that last week’s average was about 391 which was up 38% from the following week. From looking at this data, I should stay off my phone a little more and turn off a lot of the notifications that don't really matter. Nowadays, people always have their phones with them or in their hands. </p>

<!--In this section, we'll move from talking about us to how code and digital technology has affected the ELA classroom-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology in the ELA classroom</h2>
    <p>I believe that technology has changed in the way we teach ELA in that a lot of books are not digital. Students have books/articles right in the palm of their hands. I use technology every single day in my ELA classroom from Canvas to different online programs. It is important to address CT in an ELA classroom because it can help break things down and make concepts simpler for our students. Also, data has a lot to do with ELA from looking at test scores to looking at students grades on assignments. We analyze a lot of data at our school every day. We are also doing personalized learning which I feel that CT can play a role in that as well in designing the learning for different groups of students.   </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with ELA literacies, computational thinking, and social justice</h2>
    <p>I would really like to take the 5 computational thinking skills back into my ELA lessons. I would also like for my students to be able to create a Phoenix Code/GitHub after completing their informational/research piece of writing. I would be interested in learning how to set up a template in Phoenix Code like we had to just insert their text and pictures. I would definitely use the 5 computational thinking skills when reading novels or informational pieces in my classes. Lastly, since I also teach SS, I think having my students create a Phoenix Code/GitHub for a project would be really awesome.</p>
